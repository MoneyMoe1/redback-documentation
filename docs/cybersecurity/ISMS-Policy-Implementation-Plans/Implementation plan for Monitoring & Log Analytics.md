# Monitoring & Log Analytics  

## Objective Summary
To develop an easy way to implement a cost-effective deployment plan for our Monitoring & Log Analytics policies and procedures.  

## Key Subjects  

### 1. Research tools that can be used to collect and analyse log data:
- **Splunk**: A popular log monitoring and analysis tool that collects, saves, examines, and reports on any sort of machine-made data, whether structured or unstructured application logs, using a multi-line interface.  
- **Mezmo**: Allows you to monitor and analyse log files in real-time. It is accessible in the cloud and enables you to look up, save, and keep data from any application or system, such as Windows, Linux, AWS, and Python.  

### 2. Redefine key assets and data categories  
**Key Assets**
- Fitness gadgets: heart rate monitors, wearable devices  
- Platforms for gamified exercise: software that includes game components.  
- Health Monitoring Systems: Tools and applications that monitor the safety of exercise.  

**Data Categories**
- **User Data**: Health measurements and personal data.  
- **Activity logs**: Performance metrics comprise exercise data.  
- **Engagement Information**: User interactions and gamification analytics.  
- **Safety Information**: Health Alerts, Injury Reports.  

### 3. Redefine Roles and Responsibilities  
- **Security experts**: Safeguard user information and guarantee the safety of the infrastructure and fitness applications.  
- **Compliance**: Ensures that internal log management rules and legal requirements are followed.  
- **Log Administrator**: Oversees the policies for log retention, storage, and collection.  

### 4. Ensure all digital assets are covered in deployment â€“ explain how they will be covered  
- **Automated Monitoring**: To quickly identify errors and problems, implement automated monitoring systems that continuously track and send alerts based on log data from all assets.  
- **Frequent Audits**: Update configurations whenever new assets are added and conduct routine audits to ensure that all assets are being properly monitored and logged.  

### 5. Cost Effectiveness:
- One user can utilize 500 MB of Splunk each day for free. Splunk also has two paid options for more sophisticated features, with pricing available upon request. Mezmo provides a 14-day free trial in addition to several paid choices and a free version, allowing the user to test the tools before fully committing.
